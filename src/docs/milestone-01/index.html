        <h2>Overview</h2>
        Our SimpleTranslator web application aims to break down language
        barriers with text translation software. This application will have a
        feature that enhances user engagement and aids memory retention. We hope
        to provide a seamless translation between user-specified languages,
        catering to a wide array of linguistic needs. We will have a feature
        that saves every translation made by the user, creating a personalized
        and accessible record of their learning journey. After every 12
        translations of single words or phrases, users will be encouraged to
        participate in a memory game that draws directly from the translation
        history. This integration ensures that the vocabulary and phrases used
        in the game is relevant and tailored to the user's recent learning
        activities. We include an option to disable this feature, although we
        highly encourage users to explore this unique learning opportunity. By
        combining the utility of a translation tool with the engaging experience
        of a language learning game, SimpleTranslator is aimed to make language
        acquisition more enjoyable for everyone.
